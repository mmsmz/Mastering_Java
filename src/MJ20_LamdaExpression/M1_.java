            // 1. Functional Programming
            // 2. Lamda Expression
            // 3. Stream API

        // 1. we can define methods in the inteface.
        // 2. functional programming -  behavior
                // there is two techniques to code.
                    // 1. Imperative Programming - we define : what to do and how to do it?
                    // 2. Declarative Programming - - we define : what to do ?
        // 3. Lamda Expression
        // 4. Stream API - it helps Concurrency and functional programming


        // Stream API
            // we have certain methods of stream api and it was introduced
